       <h2>1. Class Fundamentals</h2><BR>
        <h3>A class is a blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will possess. Classes encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit, promoting code organization, reusability, and maintainability. They serve as templates that describe the state and behavior that objects of that type will have.</h3><br>
        <h2>2. Inheritance</h2><br>
        <h3>Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, creating a parent-child relationship between classes. The child class (subclass) can reuse, extend, or modify the behavior of the parent class (superclass). This mechanism promotes code reuse and establishes natural hierarchies between classes. Inheritance enables polymorphism and helps in creating more specialized classes from general ones.

</h3><br>
<h2>3. Encapsulation</h2><br>
<h3>Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class), while restricting direct access to some of the object's components. This is typically achieved through access modifiers like public, private, and protected. Encapsulation helps in data hiding, preventing accidental modification of data, and maintaining the integrity of the object's state. It allows for better control over how data is accessed and modified.

</h3><br>
<h2>4. Polymorphism
</h2><br>
<h3>Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). There are two main types: compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding). Polymorphism provides flexibility in code design, allows for more generic programming, and enables methods to work with objects of different classes through a common interface.

</h3><br>
<h2>5. Abstraction</h2><br>
<h3>Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstract classes and interfaces are common tools for implementing abstraction. Abstraction reduces complexity by hiding unnecessary details, makes code more modular and maintainable, and allows programmers to work with high-level concepts without worrying about low-level implementation details.
